Consider the two stage production line shown in the figure below. Jobs after being processed by workstation WS1 is routed to the next workstation WS2 with a probability of p = 0.75 and the rest are routed back to the same workstation for rework. Every time a job is routed back for rework its processing time in WS1 is reduced in half1
The inter-arrival time of new jobs and service times in both the workstations are known to be exponentially distributed. The parameters of these distributions can be estimated from the time samples given in the attached file. Build a simulation model for this system
to answer the following questions.
 1. What is the average number of visits to workstation WS1 for a job?
 2. What is the average lead time of a part being manufactured in this system?
 3. What is the change in the capacity of workstation WS1 that will result in reducing  the job average lead time in half?

    
 Prepare a two page presentation describing your results. Submit a hard copy of the two
 page presentation on the due date in class. Be sure to address all the issues related to simulation modeling and experiments discussed in class.
